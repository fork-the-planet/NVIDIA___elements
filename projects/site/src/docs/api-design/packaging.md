## Dependencies

Dependencies should be carefully considered as they impose the cost onto all consumers. Before adding dependencies, consider the following:

- Can the Web Platform do this today?
- Can something on the Web Platform standards track + polyfill do this?
- Is this dependency tree-shakable and has minimal performance impact?
- Does this dependency avoid polluting globals and prototypes?

List dependencies within the published package.json and do not bundle them with the library. The host application handles bundling dependencies, enabling its build pipeline to tree-shake and de-duplicate dependencies.

```json
{
  "dependencies": {
    "@floating-ui/dom": "^1.0.3",
    "lit": "^3.2.0",
    "lit-html": "^3.2.0"
  },
  "optionalDependencies": {
    "@lit-labs/scoped-registry-mixin": "^1.0.1",
    "@webcomponents/scoped-custom-element-registry": "^0.0.9",
    "construct-style-sheets-polyfill": "^3.1.0",
    "element-internals-polyfill": "^1.3.10"
  }
}
```

If a dependency is a feature or optional, list it under the optional dependencies.

## Build Output

Element libraries should not bundle elements or dependencies. This prevents the host application build from being able to tree-shake or construct an accurate representation of the dependency tree. But you can still apply minification to each module independently.

Build outputs should target the latest ES2020+. Build outputs should not compile to ES5 and only ship standard ESM modules. Host applications can always compile dependencies down to an older version of ES.

## Entrypoints

Each element should provide a standalone entrypoint for consumption. This enables consumers to choose which elements to load/import, improving performance and API stability.

```typescript
import  { Button } from '@nvidia-elements/core/button';
import  { Dialog } from '@nvidia-elements/core/dialog';
```

## Side Effects & Registration

Elements should not automatically register themselves to the customElementsRegistry.
Rather you should isolate side effects like registration to a single file.

```typescript
// example define.js
import '@nvidia-elements/core/icon/define.js';
import '@nvidia-elements/core/button/define.js';
import { Dialog } from './dialog.js';

customElements.get('nve-dialog') || customElements.define('nve-dialog', MlvDialog);
```

If an element depends on other elements then you should include those elements in the registration file as well to ensure the build constructs a proper dependency tree.

```typescript
import '@nvidia-elements/core/button/define.js';
import '@nvidia-elements/core/dialog/define.js';
```

Isolated registration allows the consumer to control when to load an element. This future proofs the API to allow scoped element registries.

<nve-alert status="warning">Warning: isolated side-effects are critical for certain micro-frontend use cases.</nve-alert>

The `package.json` should have the `sideEffects` entry set to `false` and list any element registrations to the explicit sideEffects entry. This enables tools like Webpack and Rollup to properly define dependency graphs and tree-shake.
