# Forms

The forms utility library provides a base mixin to make it easy to create form associated custom elements. Form associated custom elements enable components to integrate with form value state and validation. This creates a reliable and predictable API contract for components. This project is in the early stages of exploration. [Project Source]({{ELEMENTS_REPO_BASE_URL}}/tree/main/projects/forms)

## Getting Started

```shell
# local .npmrc file
registry={{ELEMENTS_REGISTRY_URL}}

# https://registry.npmjs.org
npm login

# install
