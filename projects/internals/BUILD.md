# Build, Infrastructure, and CI/CD

This is an outline of the tooling that runs the Elements monorepo. This tooling powers a fully automated continuous deployment of many npm packages as well as documentation. This configuration enables:

- Building 30+ libraries, packages and starter projects
- 3500+ unit tests, visual regressions tests and performance lighthouse tests
- Fully automated deployment, versioning and publishing of packages and documentation

The **CI pipeline takes an average of ~10 minutes** from the moment a PR merges to deploying and becoming available to end users. The average clone, install, and build of the **CI pipeline locally takes about ~1-2 min** on a MacBook M series.

The local CI job is the same CI job run in GitHub Actions, this ensures that if it passes locally, there is a high probability it passes in CI without issue.

## GitHub Features and Integrations

The Elements repo uses standard GitHub tooling to run its CI/CD pipeline.
The [`.github/workflows/ci.yml`](https://github.com/NVIDIA/elements/blob/main/.github/workflows/ci.yml) contains the configuration for the entire pipeline.

- [GitHub Pages Hosting](https://docs.github.com/en/pages)

  Deploy static site hosting with GitHub Actions workflows.

- [GitHub Actions CI/CD](https://docs.github.com/en/actions)

  Automated workflows for building, testing, and deploying on every push and pull request.

- [GitHub Actions Caching](https://docs.github.com/en/actions/writing-workflows/choosing-what-your-workflow-does/caching-dependencies-to-speed-up-workflows)

  The pipeline leverages GitHub Actions cache to cache pnpm installations between jobs, which drastically improves CI speed.

- [Issue Templates](https://docs.github.com/en/communities/using-templates-to-encourage-useful-issues-and-pull-requests)

  Issues templates provide an easy way for users to file bugs or feature requests. This helps ensure the teams get the information they need to have a productive discussion with users.

## Build

The following are the repo wide tools that apply to all source code and projects.

- [mise](https://mise.en.dev/)

  mise installs and activates the repository toolchain from `mise.toml`, including Node.js, pnpm, Vale, Go, and Git LFS. CI uses the same manifest through the shared setup action.

- [pnpm Package Manager](https://pnpm.io/)

  pnpm is a NodeJS package manager that enables highly cacheable and fast installs of Node packages.

- [Wireit](https://github.com/google/wireit)

  Wireit provides a way to unify node based build tooling across the repo, enabling build caching and dependency based build systems like Bazel.

- [Semantic Release](https://github.com/semantic-release/semantic-release)

  An open source tool for managing automatic publishing and deployment of libraries and packages following semver. Executes a release in the CI environment after every successful build. No human is directly involved in the release process and the tool guarantees releases remain unromantic and unsentimental.

- [Vite](https://vite.dev/)

  A open source tool for compiling and building web applications. Built on Rollup and ESBuild to provide a large plugin ecosystem and fast builds.

## Linting/Formatting

- [Husky](https://github.com/typicode/husky)

  Husky provides Git hooks to run pre code check ins such as linting and commit formatting. This reduces the turnaround time catching errors before they land in a CI job.

- [Lint Staged](https://github.com/lint-staged/lint-staged)

  Provides a way to lint and format source code only within Git staging.

- [Prettier](https://prettier.io/)

  Ensures consistent code formatting for the entire repo.

- [Vale](https://vale.sh/)

  Prose linter for documentation and JSDoc comments. Enforces consistent technical writing using the Google developer documentation style guide and write-good rules. Configuration is in `.vale.ini` with custom vocabulary and rules in `config/vale/styles/`. Vale runs against `*.md` and `*.ts` files in `projects/` source directories. mise installs the Vale binary for local development and CI.

## Testing

- [Playwright](https://playwright.dev/)

  Used for real browser unit testing and visual regression testing.

- [Vitest](https://vitest.dev/)

  Built on Vite, Vitest provides testing tools and runners to execute automated tests. These tests can be unit tests, e2e tests or visual snapshots.

- [Lighthouse](https://github.com/GoogleChrome/lighthouse)

  An open source project providing a suite of e2e tests for performance, accessibility, and general best practices for web development.

## Repo Configuration

The following GitHub settings optimize code quality and stability within the repo.

- [Protected Tags](https://docs.github.com/en/repositories/managing-your-repositorys-settings-and-features/managing-repository-settings/configuring-tag-protection-rules)

  Ensure Git tags cannot be overridden or accidentally deleted. This is important for stability and Semantic Release based releases.

- [Branch Protection Rules](https://docs.github.com/en/repositories/configuring-branches-and-merges-in-your-repository/managing-protected-branches/about-protected-branches)

  Protects the `main` branch and requires going through the PR Review/CI Pipeline process.

- [Branch Protection: Require Linear History](https://docs.github.com/en/repositories/configuring-branches-and-merges-in-your-repository/managing-protected-branches/about-protected-branches#require-linear-history)

  Enforce that PRs must be rebased before merging. This ensures a clean Git history with no merge commits. This also ensures there is a 1:1 match of a commit and its release.

- [Branch Protection: Require Status Checks](https://docs.github.com/en/repositories/configuring-branches-and-merges-in-your-repository/managing-protected-branches/about-protected-branches#require-status-checks-before-merging)

  Ensure the PR passes the CI pipeline which includes automated unit, integration, and performance tests.

- [GitHub Pages](https://docs.github.com/en/pages)

  Provides an easy to deploy static host for documentation and UI applications.

- [Scheduled Workflows](https://docs.github.com/en/actions/writing-workflows/choosing-when-your-workflow-runs/events-that-trigger-workflows#schedule)

  Scheduled workflows run nightly builds of the documentation as well as full runs of [Lighthouse CI](https://github.com/GoogleChrome/lighthouse-ci) against each of the 50+ components in the Elements library.

## Release

[Semantic Release](https://github.com/semantic-release/semantic-release) is an open source tool for managing automatic publishing and deployment of libraries and packages following [SEMVER](https://semver.org/). This enables a fix or feature to be available within minutes of it merging and passing the CI automated tests. To integrate into GitHub, complete the following:

- Generate a `GITHUB_TOKEN` (automatically available in GitHub Actions)
- Generate an `NPM_TOKEN` via npm [trusted publishers](https://docs.npmjs.com/trusted-publishers) or access token
- Add `NPM_TOKEN` to the [repository secrets](https://docs.github.com/en/actions/security-for-github-actions/security-guides/using-secrets-in-github-actions)
- Follow standard [Semantic Release](https://github.com/semantic-release/semantic-release) tooling/configuration. To see an example of this look at the Elements [release.config.cjs](https://github.com/NVIDIA/elements/blob/main/release.config.cjs) file.

## Git LFS

To add large static assets such as images and video use Git LFS.

1. Add the asset paths to the `.gitattributes` file. Be sure to commit the update to `.gitattributes` first.

```shell
# example path
projects/site/assets/**/*.webm filter=lfs diff=lfs merge=lfs -text
projects/site/assets/**/*.webp filter=lfs diff=lfs merge=lfs -text
```

2. Once you commit `.gitattributes`, add the assets as a followup commit to ensure Git LFS stores them.
