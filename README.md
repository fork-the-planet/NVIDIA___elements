# NVIDIA Elements

The Design System and UI Agent Harness for AI/ML Factories, Robotics, and Autonomous Vehicles.

- **Agent-ready tooling:** CLI and MCP expose component APIs, tokens, examples, imports, validation, and setup to terminals and AI assistants.
- **Framework agnostic:** Web Components run in React, Angular, Vue, Svelte, Lit, plain HTML, server-rendered templates, and mixed stacks.
- **Built for AI infrastructure:** Operational UI for AI/ML workloads, autonomous vehicle tools, and robotics consoles.
- **Stable API contracts:** Skills and lint guide authoring best practices, common UI patterns, and automated static analysis.

## Organization

The repository is organized as a top-level **overall** repository and, inside that, libraries are broken up into individual **project** directories.

Project directories have their own `package.json` and commands. But all setup for the CI and development needs to happen at the root **repository** level.

Examples of projects include:

- `/projects/starters` - Suite of standardized starter apps for Elements and Patterns
- `/projects/core` - Elements library: curated UI maintained by the Elements team
- `/projects/themes` - Elements Theme library: provides a set of supported themes for Element based projects
- `/projects/styles` - Elements Styles library: provides a set of CSS utilities for layout and typography

## Development

### Setup

To set up repository dependencies and run the full build, run the following commands at the **root** of the repository:

```shell
# install required dependencies
brew install git-lfs
git lfs install
git lfs pull
curl -o- https://raw.githubusercontent.com/nvm-sh/nvm/v0.40.1/install.sh | bash
. ~/.nvm/nvm.sh
nvm install
npm install -g corepack@0.34.7
corepack enable
corepack prepare --activate
pnpm i --frozen-lockfile --prefer-offline
```

```shell
# run ci pipeline locally (lint, build, test)
pnpm run ci
```

#### Troubleshooting

If you are coming from development from a different repository, you may need to install a new version of node in `nvm`. If you see an error message to this effect, [refer to the nvm docs](https://github.com/nvm-sh/nvm?tab=readme-ov-file#usage) for installing the missing node version and for directions on switching between versions of `node` using `nvm`. Once `nvm` is installed you can switch to the repository defined node and pnpm versions by re-running the [setup/install step](#setup) above.

If you actively switch between different repositories, run `nvm use && corepack prepare --activate` in the root of the project to ensure use of the correct node/pnpm version.

### Building

Both the top-level repository and each project have a set of standardized npm scripts. To build and test all projects, run `pnpm run ci` at the root of the repository.

#### Top-Level Repository

- `ci`: run full build/lint/test
- `ci:all`: entire CI process: build, lint, unit/lighthouse/visual tests
- `ci:reset`: clear all caches/dependencies then reinstall dependencies

#### Individual Projects

Common project scripts include:

- `dev`: run in watch mode
- `build`: run project/library build
- `test`: run unit tests
- `test:lighthouse`: run lighthouse performance tests
- `test:visual`: run playwright visual regression tests
- `test:axe`: run axe tests for a11y

The available scripts vary by project. Check the project's `package.json` before running project-specific commands.

To learn in detail how the repo is built and run see our [build system documentation](https://github.com/NVIDIA/elements/blob/main/projects/internals/BUILD.md).

## Workflow

Before creating a branch or pull request be sure to make a [new issue or feature request](https://github.com/NVIDIA/elements/issues/new) first for the team to evaluate. This will help ensure that your work aligns with the goals of the project and that you are not duplicating effort.

### Create a Branch

Use a descriptive branch name with the `topic/` prefix. Example `topic/bug-fix`.

```shell
git checkout -b topic/bug-fix
```

Once your branch is created, make your source code changes. Once your changes are complete run `pnpm run ci` in the root of the repo to run all the builds and tests. If all tests pass, you are ready to create a PR.

### Commit Messages

The repo uses [Semantic Release](https://semantic-release.gitbook.io/semantic-release/) to manage package changes. Commit messages determine the type of release on merge. [Commit Lint](https://commitlint.js.org/) will enforce and catch any formatting issues in commits.

```shell
git commit -a -s -m "fix(core): disable multi-select"
```

Keep commit names focused on the changes you are making as the commit message is what is used to determine the next release and generated changelog notes.

### Opening a Pull Request

Once you have committed your changes to your branch locally, push them to the remote GitHub repository.

```bash
git push --set-upstream origin topic/bug-fix
```

Open a new [Pull Request](https://github.com/NVIDIA/elements/pulls) in GitHub. Request review from the team members and apply the appropriate labels in the GitHub UI, for example, `type:fix` and `scope(core)`.

#### Amending Commit

**If there are changes requested**, make the requested changes locally and amend the commit.

```shell
git commit -a --amend --no-edit
```

This will add the changes to your existing commit. Then push the updated commit back to the remote branch for review.

```shell
git push --force origin topic/bug-fix
```

#### Rebasing Commit

Sometimes changes are merged to main before your PR is approved. To update your local branch to contain the latest changes from main you will need to rebase.

```shell
git checkout main # Switch to main branch
git pull # Pull down any new changes
git checkout topic/bug-fix # Switch back to your topic branch
git rebase main # Rebase your branch onto the latest main
```

You may have to resolve any merge conflicts that arise from this process. Once complete, push the updated branch back to the remote repository for review.

### New Project

When creating a new project, ex: `./projects/code`, make sure to add the project to the `pnpm-workspace.yaml` located at the root directory.

### Release

Once your Pull Request is approved, you can merge it into `main` via the GitHub UI. This will trigger a [new release](https://github.com/NVIDIA/elements/releases) of the package automatically. The version number will be bumped based on the type of commit (see above). The [changelog](https://NVIDIA.github.io/elements/docs/changelog/) will also be updated with the changes from the commits in the PR.
